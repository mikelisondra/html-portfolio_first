<h1>The best Movies According to Mike</h1>
<h2>My top 10 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie of all.</p>

<h3>The Wind Rises</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime. Its inspiring mood makes me view my goals seriously.</p>

<h3>Schindler's List</h3>
<p>This movie shows the other side of humanity, that behind every evil there is still a human weeping.</p>

<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>This is one of the most amazing movies I have ever watched!</p>

<h3>Godzilla Minus One</h3>
<p>This movie is the newest one on my favorites. The story is good, the characters are great, and the CGI's are amazing.</p>

<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>This movie is really inspiring!</p>

<h3>The White Tiger</h3>
<p>This movie shows how dark reality can be, how low people can go to, and how high one's ambition can be given
the correct situation. I like it.</p>

<h3>12th Fail</h3>
<p>This is also a new movie, released on 2023. I recently failed one of my subject myself and I find this movie kind of
relatable in  a sense. I find the characters and the story really inspiring.</p>

<h3>Napoleon</h3>
<p>This movie is great. Who doesnt like conquering? who doesnt like Napoleon? even the British likes him.</p>

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>This movie is why I am still around doing my things. Like the characters in this movie, whenever something 
I like doesnt come around the way I hope it would, I always take it as a challenge and still do my best. To hope that
"All is well".</p>

<p>These are my favorite movies for now.<br /> 
Like life, my favorite movies are not constant.</p>
